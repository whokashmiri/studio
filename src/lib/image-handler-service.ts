 * Processes an image Data URI. Currently, this is a placeholder.
 * In a real application, this could involve client-side compression
 * before storing the Data URI or preparing it for upload to a service like Firebase Storage.
 *
 * For this version, images (as Data URIs) will be stored directly in Firestore.
 * Note: Storing large Data URIs in Firestore can hit document size limits (1MB).
 * For production, Firebase Storage is recommended for image files.
 *
 * @param fileDataUrl The file to process, as a base64 Data URI.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the processed Data URI (or original if no processing) or null if input is invalid.
