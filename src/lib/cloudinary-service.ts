// NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_actual_cloud_name" // This one can be public if needed by client for direct (unsigned) uploads with presets
// CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key" // MUST be kept server-side
// CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret" // MUST be kept server-side

 * @param fileDataUrl The file to upload, as a base64 Data URI.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a simulated Cloudinary URL, or null if the simulated upload fails.
