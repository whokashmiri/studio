// IMPORTANT: THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER SERVICE.
// In a real application, you would have a backend API endpoint (e.g., a Next.js API Route or Server Action)
// that securely handles the upload to Cloudinary using your API secret.
// DO NOT expose your Cloudinary API secret on the client-side.

// Required Environment Variables for a real backend implementation:
// NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_actual_cloud_name" // This one can be public if needed by client for direct (unsigned) uploads with presets
// CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key" // MUST be kept server-side
// CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret" // MUST be kept server-side

/**
 * Simulates uploading a file (as a Data URI) to Cloudinary.
 * In a real implementation, this function would not exist on the client.
 * Instead, the client would send the file/data URI to a secure backend endpoint,
 * which would then use the Cloudinary SDK (with API Key and Secret) to perform the upload.
 * 
 * FOR PROTOTYPING: This function now returns the original fileDataUrl to ensure the
 * previewed image matches the "uploaded" image. In a real scenario, it would return
 * a Cloudinary URL.
 * 
 * @param fileDataUrl The file to upload, as a base64 Data URI.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the fileDataUrl itself for prototype display, or null if the simulated processing fails.
